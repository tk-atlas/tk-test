This here's a tail for all the fellas
Tryin; to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin; body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munching
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishing
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Looking for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So dongt hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showing, so you're goin
Could care less about the five you're blowing
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sitting in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow."
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way"
Girls are faking goodness saking
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lying on a beach perpetrating a tan
So a brother with the money can be their man
So on the beach you're strolling real high rolling
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with something to prove
So dongt just stand there bust a move

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hoping you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you wongt be getting
So you start thinking then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feeling really fine cause the girl is stacked
Receptiongs jumping bass is pumping
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumping
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do G bust a move
